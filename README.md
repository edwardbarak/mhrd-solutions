MHRD Solutions
==============
My solutions to the NAND to CPU design simulator [MHRD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/).

Exercise prompts provided by Funghisoft, and extracted from their savestate file format.

## savestate extraction
If you want to extract your own logic gate designs from MHRD, I created a tool [here](https://github.com/edwardbarak/mhrd-export). You can download the executable from the "Releases" tab.
